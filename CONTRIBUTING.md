# Contributing
We want this technologies repo to be contributed to by all members of the team, to make this possible we need to ensure that things like PRs and branches are consistent.

A few general things to know:
- The repo should be forked into your Github account and worked on from there.
- Make all changes inside of a `feature/*` branch
- When ready, create a PR from your feature branch into `master`
- Be *descriptive*

## Pull Requests
Pull requests should be opened to add your features / changes; ensure you're merging from your forked repo on a relevant `feature/*` branch.

- Ensure all relevant links have been added / updated where neccesary in the rest of the repo
- Ensure only one feature per PR, don't try to bundle multiple features into one
- Ensure you are working on a `feature/*` branch (no one likes to work directly on master, we'll get the pitchforks out)
- Make sure your commit messages are descriptive of your changes
- Ensure your PR title gives a good overview of your changes & that the description explains exactly what the feature is & the reason behind the PR
- Make sure to add the relevant reviewers based on the feature you're adding (this is up to you to decide, add whoever best fits with your changes)
