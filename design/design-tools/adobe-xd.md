## Setting up an Artboard - Desktop

The default settings for a desktop artboard is:

Artboard width: 1920
- Recommended workspace view: 1200

- **Grid settings for default Bootstrap website (closest setting)**
* Grid: Layout
* Columns: 12
* Gutter width: 30
* Column Width: 72
* Linked Margin: 366


**Grid setting for fluid Bootstrap website**
* Linked Margin: 3


Viewport height (default): 1080


**Tips:**
- Draggable guides can be created by hovering over the left and top of the artboard and then dragging onto it.


## Setting up an Artboard - Tablet / Mobile

The project specifications should document which tablet/mobile devices, the app will be primarily used on.
If the requirements are based on multiple resolutions then you should design to the smallest device as it is easier to scale to a larger resolution (mobile first design).


**Tips:**
- Create multiple artboards of different resolutions sizes (if needed).
- The smallest screen size should be optimised for an iPhone 5.


## Assets

Keep your design styling constant and save valuable time by creating reusable/global assets.

The following assets can be created:

**Colors**

Store your main projects colour pallet.


**Character Styles**

Create different typography styles to be used throughout the project.


**Components**

Create components such as navigation bars, buttons, cards or any other reusable elements.


**Keep in mind:**

_'Master'_ components - These are the main components which when edited, all child components will be edited in the project.

_'Child'_ components - These are copies of the Master Components but can be edited without affecting the master or other child components. eg. change component colour


## Prototyping

After you have finished creating your design, you should turn it into a prototype which will allow users to navigation through the wireframes. By doing this you have the ability to test the user-flow and everything is correct, etc.

Having a working prototype will allow the client to navigate through designs and get a clear idea of the end product.

Having broken or missing links will cause the artboard to be hidden from view when exporting n prototype and developer view.


## Exporting

Once the wireframes and prototypes are completed, you can export into the following views:

**PDF**

Produces a PDF version of artboards which can be easily emailed.


**Share for Review**

Creates a linked prototype version of the app or website where clients can easily navigate through. Clients can create and pin comments to the wireframes to request changes etc.


**Share for Development**

This option creates an overview of the project where you can see a detailed view of the page styling. The options include colour pallets, typography, assets(with download option), along with all the styling options, interactions and navigation links.
